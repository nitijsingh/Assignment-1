# Task
Evaluate the impact of ICT on GDP growth in developed, developing and emerging countries using logistc regression and fixed effect model.

# Introduction
In a rapidly changing world, societies have experienced a paradigm shift of how things used to be done to new ways, which have been enabled by the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). ICT has made world to a small village with better living standards. Improved standards of living usually correlate with productivity growth.
Different methodologies can be applied for the study of the impact of ICT on GDP percentage growth, however it might be important to distinguish why the impact differs between developed, developing and emerging countries. Lacking micro and macro level data sets in developing and emerging nations could be a reason explanation the little evidence. Lacking absorptive capacities such as appropriate levels of human capital or insufficient funding for conducting research and development are all valid factors to consider when studying the effect of ICT in these different country classifications. On the other hand, it is often the case that ICT is referred to as a catalyst for innovation and modernization, lowering transaction costs, blurring boundaries and spreading information that will make societies better off.

# Definition of key variables 
To better comprehend the results of the study it is important to define key variables:
1.	Developed Countries: while there is no one, set definition we classify developed countries as those with a relatively high level of economic growth and security. Specifically we look at the GDP per capita levels and GNI. When above $ 23000 in 2013, we consider a country developed.
2.	Developing Countries: we define developing countries as those lacking in terms of its economy, infrastructure and industrial base. We associate low standard of livings and we group under this category all those countries with a GDP/GNI ratio lower than $6500 in 2013
3.	Emerging Markets: also for emerging markets, there has not been a commonly accepted definition, however we define them as those nations experiencing rapid growth, industrialization and socio economic development. There are 3 aspects underlying the definition of emerging markets: 1) the absolute level of economic development, indicated by the average GDP per capita; 2) the relative pace of economic development, indicated by the GDP growth rate; 3) the system of market governance and the extent and stability of free market systems (Arnold, D. & Quelch, A., 1998) We only focus on point 2, studying the effect that ICT investments have on annual GDP percentage growth 
4.	GDP: Defined as an aggregate measure of production. It is the sum of the gross values added of all resident institutional units engaged in production (plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs). The sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) is measured in purchasers’ prices less the value of imports of goods and services, or the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.
5.	GDP Growth: similar to GDP. The sum of the final uses of goods and services are measured in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) expressed in 2013 U.S dollars
6.	ICT: The acronym ICT stands for Information Communication Technology. We define ICT as the acquisition of equipment and computer software that provide access to information through telecommunication. For the purpose of this study we will only look at 2 communication technologies, the Internet and cell phones as we assume these to be key drivers in the boosting economic growth.
7.	ICT Capital Services growth:  Defined as the change in the flow of productive services provided by ICT assets. We focus on three types of ICT assets namely computer hardware and equipment, telecommunication equipment, and computer software and services. The underlying capital stock series are calculated from the investment data using the perpetual inventory method. The aggregation of the growth in capital services over the different asset types is calculated using the user cost approach.
8.	Non ICT Capital Service growth: Refers to the change in the flow of productive services provided by non-ICT assets. Three types of non-ICT assets are included—transport equipment; plant, machinery, and other non-ICT equipment; and construction, building and other structures. The underlying capital stock series are calculated from the investment data using the perpetual inventory method. The aggregation of the growth in capital services over the different asset types is calculated using the user cost approach.
