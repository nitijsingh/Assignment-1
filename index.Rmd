# Abstract 

This paper aims at analyzing the validity of the relationship between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and economic development, expressed in terms of GDP growth. The study provides a cross-country view on the issue upon assessing the impact of ICT on economic growth for 54 countries from the developed, emerging and developing world. Our results show that even though the impact of ICT capital stock per capita is significant in the developed and emerging economies, it cannot be used to make generalizations for the developing countries.
