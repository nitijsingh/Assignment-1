# "The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics". Tasks:

Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file.

The repository will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics.

At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way.

Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged.

# Data sets used 

In first part of the assignment with have used the swiss data set in order to understand the relation between occupation and fertility which leads to demographic changes in the swiss society.

In the second data set we have used the women data set in order to understand the weight and height relationship.

# Name of the files in the repository 
1. Data set swiss - 'fertilityrelation.r' and dynamic linkage with 'cor.r'
2. Data set women


# Result 

In the first data set we see that there is a direct relation between occupation and fertility rates. The region which have higher percentage of men employed in the agriculture those regions have higher fertility rate; as compared to regions which more people in army scoring highest mark in the examination.

In the second data set we observe that there is a direct correlation between height and weight of the women in the data set.
